#This function reads a priorities CSV file and returns the priorities in a single data structure
#as follows:  The top level data structure is a dictionary with two entries.  Each entry is
#indexed by a string that also serves as the prefix for each entity to be paired.  For example,
#when reading "Example Priorities File.csv", the two top level keys are 'R' (for red) and 'B' (for blue).
#The values stored in the top level dictionary are two more dictionaries.  This lower level
#dictionary is indexed by an entity name (e.g. 'B3' or 'R2' from "Example Priorities File.csv").  The
#lower level dictionary values are lists that indicate priorities from most desired to least
#desired.  For example, calling priorities['B']['B3'][1] would return 'R2' indicating that R2
#is B3's second choice mate.
